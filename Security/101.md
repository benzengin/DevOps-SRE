# What is a sealed Secret?

Sealed Secrets are a "one-way" encrypted Secret that can be created by anyone, but can only be decrypted by the controller running in the target cluster.
The Sealed Secret is safe to share publicly, upload to git repositories, post to twitter, etc.

# What is Docker Content Trust? And how does it work?

At its core, Docker Content Trust is very simple. It is logic inside the Docker client that can verify images you pull or deploy from a registry server, signed on a Docker Notary server of your choosing.

The Docker Notary tool allows publishers to digitally sign their collections while users get to verify the integrity of the content they pull. Through The Update Framework (TUF), Notary users can provide trust over arbitrary collections of data and manage the operations necessary to ensure freshness of content. If you have not used a Notary server before, check out Docker's introductory guide.
