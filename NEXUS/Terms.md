# What is a cleanup policy (Nexus)?

Cleanup policies define the criteria that control which components get cleaned up. The cleanup task controls when cleanup is performed. The strategy for this feature was to use a concept familiar to Nexus Repositories users (tasks) and introduce user-configurable criteria to drive actual cleanup behavior.
