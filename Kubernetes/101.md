# OVERVIEW

## What is Kubernetes (k8s)?

Open-source container orchestration tool designed to automate, deploying, scaling, and operating containerized applications  

Allows organizations to increase their velocity by releasing and recovering faster  

**-Kubernetes is a distributed system**  
**-Machines may be physical, virtual, on-prem, or in the cloud**  
**-Schedules containers on machines**  
**-Moves containers as machines are added/removed**  
**-Can use different container runtimes**  
**-Modular, extensible design**  

**USAGE:**  
Declarative Configuration  
Deploy Containers  
Wire Up Networking  
Scale and Expose Services  

**OPERATIONS:**  
Automaticall Recover From Machine Failures  
Built-in Support For Machine Maintenance  
Join Clusters With Federation  

**FEATURES:**  
Automated deployment rollout and rollback  
Seamless horizontal scaling  
Secret management  
Service discovery and load balancing  
Linux and Windows container support  
Simple log collection  
Stateful application support  
Persistent volume management  
CPU and memory quotas  
Batch job processing  
Role-based access control  

## Kubernetes Architecture  

-Cluster referes to all of the machines collectively and can be thought of as the entire running system  
-**Nodes** are the machines in the cluster  
-Nodes are categorized as **workers** or **masters**  
-**Worker** nodes include software to run containers managed by the Kubernetes control plane  
-**Master** nodes run the control plane  
-The **control plane** is a set of APIs and software that Kubernetes users interact with  
-The APIs and software are referred to as **master components**  

**SCHEDULING:**  
-Control plane schedules containers onto nodes  
-Scheduling decisions consider required CPU and other factors  
-Scheduling referes to the decision process of placing containers onto node  

**Kubernetes PODs**  
-Groups of containers  
-Pods are the smallest building block in Kubernetes
